# Ernest-Payphone-LCD
PCB to allow you to attach an LCD to an Ernest Telecom Payphone

This is useful for programming or even just general use. Confirmed to work on a D7, should work on the others too. Uses a standard 16x2 LCD, 14 pin ribbon cable and some pin header. Add resistor if your screen is backlit.

This screen is needed for local programming on the phones. See phone manuals for more information on how to program.
